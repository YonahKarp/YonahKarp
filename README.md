## About Me
Software Developer with 6+ years professional experience. 
Genuinely enjoys programming, hard worker, fast and avid learner, capable and persistent problem solver, can synthesize new information efficiently. 
Great teamwork and communication skills. Detail oriented with an eye for clean design. 


Currently taking courses to gain a Masters in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning.
I like to spend time on side projects (even when I don't have the time). I feel most productive/fulfilled when I'm building something new.
